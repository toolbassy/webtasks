                    from 1999-2006[2] and was replaced by the BMW E70. The E53 was developed at a time when BMW
                    still owned Land Rover and as such shares many components and designs with both the Land Rover Range
                    Rover L322 model (specifically the Hill Descent System and Off Road Engine Management system) and
                    the BMW E39 5 Series (specifically engines and electronic systems). The entire in-car entertainment
                    system (Radio Function, Navigation System, Television and Telecommunications systems) are shared
                    with other BMWs and L322.</p>

                    Porsche 928 was discontinued. It is also Porsche's first off road variant vehicle since its Super
